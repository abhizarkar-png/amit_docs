============== IIS ==========

A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form
 Web pages to users

Internet Information Services (IIS) turns a computer into a Web server that can provide
 World Wide Web publishing services, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) services, 
Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) services, and Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) 
services. You can use IIS to host and manage Web sites and other Internet content once you 
obtain an IP address, register your domain on a DNS server, and configure your network appropriately. 

=========== DHCP =============
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client/server protocol that automatically provides 
an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as 
the subnet mask and default gateway.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a communications protocol that network administrators
 use to centrally manage and automate the network configuration of devices attaching to an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol used to provide quick, automatic, and central management 
for the distribution of IP addresses within a network.

DHCP is also used to configure the proper subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server information on the device.

As the name suggests, DHCP is used to control the network configuration of a host through a remote server.

DHCP is useful for automatic configuration of client network interfaces. When configuring the client system, 
the administrator chooses DHCP instead of specifying an IP address, netmask, gateway, or DNS servers. 
The client retrieves this information from the DHCP server

 DHCP is short for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. Its main task is to automatically assign an IP address to 
devices across the network. It first checks for the next available address not yet taken by any device,
 then assigns this to a network device 

DHCP has a number of advantages:
    There is no need to manually configure each client with an IP address.

    You don't need to keep a record of the IP addresses that you have assigned.

    You can automatically assign a new IP address if you move a client to a different subnet.

    You can release the IP address of a computer that is offline and reassign the address to another computer.

    Address duplication is eliminated as DHCP automatically tracks IP address assignments.

    The DHCP server can detect unauthorised DHCP servers on the network.

============== FTP ===============
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the most widely used protocol for file transfer over 
the network. FTP uses TCP/IP for communication and it works on TCP port 21. FTP 
works  on  Client/Server  Model  where  a  client  requests  file  from  Server  and  server 
sends requested resource back to the client.

FTP uses two well-known TCP ports: Port 21 is used for the control connection,
and port 20 is used for the data connection.

The client has three components: userinterface, client control process, and the client data transfer process. 
The server has two components: the server control process and the server data transfer process. The control
connection is made between the control processes. The data connection is made between
the data transfer processes.

Figure :

FTP can transfer a file across the data connection by using one of the following three transmission modes: 
stream mode, block mode, and compressed mode.

=============== ICS ======================

Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) is the use of a device with Internet access such as 3G cellular service, 
broadband via Ethernet, or other Internet gateway as an access point for other devices.

It was implemented by Microsoft as a feature of its Windows operating system (as of Windows 98 Second 
Edition and later) for sharing a single Internet connection on one computer between other computers on 
the same local area network. It makes use of DHCP and network address translation (NAT).

===========Linux File Systems: Ext2 vs Ext3 vs Ext4 =========
Ext2

    Ext2 stands for second extended file system.
    It was introduced in 1993. Developed by Rémy Card.
    This was developed to overcome the limitation of the original ext file system.
    Ext2 does not have journaling feature.
    On flash drives, usb drives, ext2 is recommended, as it doesn’t need to do the over head of journaling.
    Maximum individual file size can be from 16 GB to 2 TB
    Overall ext2 file system size can be from 2 TB to 32 TB

Ext3

    Ext3 stands for third extended file system.
    It was introduced in 2001. Developed by Stephen Tweedie.
    Starting from Linux Kernel 2.4.15 ext3 was available.
    The main benefit of ext3 is that it allows journaling.
    Journaling has a dedicated area in the file system, where all the changes are tracked. 
When the system crashes, the possibility of file system corruption is less because of journaling.
    Maximum individual file size can be from 16 GB to 2 TB
    Overall ext3 file system size can be from 2 TB to 32 TB
    There are three types of journaling available in ext3 file system.
        Journal – Metadata and content are saved in the journal.
        Ordered – Only metadata is saved in the journal. Metadata are journaled only after writing the content to disk. This is the default.
        Writeback – Only metadata is saved in the journal. Metadata might be journaled either before or after the content is written to the disk.
    You can convert a ext2 file system to ext3 file system directly (without backup/restore).

Ext4

    Ext4 stands for fourth extended file system.
    It was introduced in 2008.
    Starting from Linux Kernel 2.6.19 ext4 was available.
    Supports huge individual file size and overall file system size.
    Maximum individual file size can be from 16 GB to 16 TB
    Overall maximum ext4 file system size is 1 EB (exabyte). 1 EB = 1024 PB (petabyte). 1 PB = 1024 TB (terabyte).
    Directory can contain a maximum of 64,000 subdirectories (as opposed to 32,000 in ext3)
    You can also mount an existing ext3 fs as ext4 fs (without having to upgrade it).
    Several other new features are introduced in ext4: multiblock allocation, delayed allocation, journal checksum. fast fsck, etc. 
All you need to know is that these new features have improved the performance and reliability of the filesystem when compared to ext3.
    In ext4, you also have the option of turning the journaling feature “off”.

====================Swap =====================================
Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. 
If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. 
While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM.
